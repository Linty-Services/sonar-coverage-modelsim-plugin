# Linty ModelSim/QuestaSim Plugin

This plugin adds the ability to import ModelSim/QuestaSim XML reports into SonarQube.

## Usage

### Generating Coverage Report from ModelSim/QuestaSim

Coverage report can be generated through the UI or command line.

#### UI

Go to **Tools > Coverage Report > Text**. The **XML format** box must be ticked.
**Code coverage > Statements**, and **Code coverage > Branches** or **Code coverage > Conditions** must be enabled
according to the type of coverage you'd like to import into SonarQube. **Condition/Expression tables** option is
necessary
to import condition coverage. Do not activate other unnecessary options such as **Toggles**.

#### Command Line

Here's an example of command line:

```bash
coverage report -file report.xml -byfile -detail -all -dump -option -code {s b c} â€“xml
```

### Importing ModelSim/QuestaSim Coverage Report into SonarQube

Add the following properties to your SonarQube analysis configuration:

* `sonar.modelsim.reportPaths`: Comma-separated list of paths (either files or directories) to ModelSim/QuestaSim XML
  report files. If the list contains a directory, all `.xml` files in this directory will be considered as
  ModelSim/QuestaSim XML reports.
* `sonar.modelsim.reportMode`: Type of secondary coverage: `branch` or `condition` (branch coverage will still be
  reported as condition coverage on the Sonarqube web interface). Statement coverage is always imported. Default value
  is `branch`.
